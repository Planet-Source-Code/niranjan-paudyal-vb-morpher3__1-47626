Please note that this program only works with a color depth True Color 
or higher!!!
For around 5X improvement on speed, compile first!


Update since v2
	You have to admit this is by far the most original program in PSC.
	Last year, i made a morphing program the likes of which had never
	been seen in PSC (it can still be downloaded!). People complained that
	it was too slow, and rightly so. I looked into the program structure and
	found that there was a number of ways of speding it up. Here is a list of
	improvements.
	1)	No more triangle filling calculations.
		all the triangles are drawn using the api onto a hdc, and then
		index of the triangle is found by using their colors values.
	2)	Triangle are not allowed to be overlapped.
	3)	Uses DIBS to speed up program.
	4)	Lots of improvements in converting Co-ortinates.
	5)	Mdi environment for ease of use.
	6)	All in all, a  better interface.

	and not to forget...

	7)	NOW YOU CAN CREATE -------->AVI<------- OF YOUR MORPHS !!!!!

Update in V3
	1)	The pictures can now be resized
	2)	the option screen show soon as you make a new morph
	3)	The files are searched for in the morph file directory if its not found
		in the original directory, allows you to move files easily
	4)	The update contains samples you can view.
	
	
Please give me some votes, and send some comments for improvements for my 4th version!
Thanks.
